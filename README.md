# Online Banking System, with python Flask



In today's fast-paced digital world, developing streamlined and efficient systems is crucial for enhancing user experiences. Recently, I created a simplified online banking system using Python Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend design. 

This system offers key functionalities like:
* New Employee registration
* Existing Employee Login
* New Customer registration
* Existing Customer Login
* Money Withdraw & Deposit
* Add transaction details to finance diary
* Admin portal

<br>
For saving the employee and customer details, I have used json, instead of sql.

<br>
<br>
To run this flask app, open a linux terminal here and execute 

`export FLASK_APP=app.py` <br> `flask run`
